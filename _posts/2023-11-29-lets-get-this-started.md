I had blogs before, and it was a seasonal thing for me. Building an audience for a blog takes work, especially in the age of microblogging and video content. Why is this different, you ask? Because this blog does not rely on the audience. I will find here my technical notes if I need to do something again. I will find here the old thoughts that allow me to retrospect how I changed and progressed (if I did). And if these texts will be helpful to others, great! But if not, the world is not ending. We will see if my theory is correct (you see, already foreshadowing that retrospect thing I mentioned).

Now, the tech stack I use is entirely alien to me. I have never coded in Ruby and have never used Jekyll before. But I got tired of the constant lookout for WordPress vulnerabilities and wanted to try blogging with a static site generator. Bear with me. I will have a lot to learn here.

The test post is nearly done, and I already have some ideas for actual posts. 

See ya around.
