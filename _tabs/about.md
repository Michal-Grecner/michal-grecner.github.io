My name is Michal and this is my personal blog.

Think of it as a public notepad and occasional brain dump. It might cover various topics that interests me, technical notes or even rants. Who knows. Certainly not me. 

Topic might vary since I was never good in not reading about interesting topics and not trying out new things.

## How to reach me online

Your best bet would be e-mail, you can find in in bottom left corner of this site.

At the time of writing this, situation with social media was little bit crazy. So pick yours, I am forced to be on many different platforms and I try to love them equaly (and fail at it).
